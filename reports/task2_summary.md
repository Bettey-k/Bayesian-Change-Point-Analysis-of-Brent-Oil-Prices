# Task 2: Change Point Analysis Summary

The Bayesian change point model identifies a significant structural break around **March 2020**.

- Estimated change point: March 2020
- Mean return before change (μ₁): lower volatility
- Mean return after change (μ₂): higher volatility
- Likely associated events: COVID-19 pandemic and OPEC+ production cuts

## Limitations
- Statistical alignment does not imply causality.
- Monthly aggregation smooths short-term shocks.
- Multiple concurrent events may influence the detected change.
